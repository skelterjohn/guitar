## original compositions

### Frog Song (Naked Man Dance)

This piece was written after a weekend of listening to various works by
Erik Satie, but especially the
[Gymnopadies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xm7s9eGxU).

It is intended to evoke the feeling of quarantine during a pandemic. The
repeated bars are not unpleasant, but a bit numbing (much like sitting in your
house all day). There is searching (the first melodic section), hope (second),
and even beauty (the C major section), but also anger and resignation (the F
major section), but no matter what it all comes back to the numbness.

### Ditto

I like to play this one on my Seagull S6 Original (steel string acoustic
dreadnought), which has a much brighter sound and long sustain compared to my
classical (Alhambra 5P).

### Wishing Tree

This piece is a guitar-ization of the song I like to sing to my children when
reading
[You and Me and the Wishing Tree](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=you+and+me+and+the+wishing+tree).

### Study No. 1 (Regret)

This is a study I wrote to help smooth out a section in
[Media Luna](http://www.knila.nl/index.php?search=own) (long page, ctrl-f the
title).

The first string is the melody, and its first use each measure should be loud and
with vibrato. The second (and sometimes third) use of that string in each measure
should be softer, sweeter, and (most importantly) regretful. It's also full of big stretches for the left hand.

## arrangements

### Suna no Hoshi by Tsuneo Imahori
From the Trigun soundtrack. Arranged by ear.

This piece was played during the procession at my wedding. So, I really like it.

### Rakuen by Tsuneo Imahori
From the Trigun soundtrack. Guitar/voice. Arranged by ear.

I found numerous terrible tabs for this piece before I decided to just sit down
and arrange it myself from the mp3. I discovered that the tuning is quite unusual,
with DAGDGD from 1 to 6, which likely accounts for all the poor arrangements I'd
discovered. I believe what I transcribed below is faithful to what was actually
played, and (as a bonus) it's not that hard once the tuning is handled.

is a cleaned-up version.
