## original compositions

### Distance

The first measure is a melody that has been stuck in my head for a long
time. Perhaps from an anime theme song? Not sure. The piece is playable
on one guitar but would probably be fun and sound nice with two.

### Quickly Eroding Icy Shoreline (var)

A variation on Gulli Björnsson's "Eroding Icy Shoreline". It follows the
original piece phrase by phrase, in a very different style.

### Frog Song (Naked Man Dance)

This piece was written after a weekend of listening to various works by
Erik Satie, but especially the
[Gymnopadies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xm7s9eGxU).

It is intended to evoke the feeling of quarantine during a pandemic. The
repeated bars are not unpleasant, but a bit numbing (much like sitting in your
house all day). There is searching (the first melodic section), hope (second),
and even beauty (the C major section), but also anger and resignation (the F
major section), but no matter what it all comes back to the numbness.

### Ditto

I like to play this one on my Seagull S6 Original (steel string acoustic
dreadnought), which has a much brighter sound and long sustain compared to my
classical (Alhambra 5P).

### Wishing Tree

This piece is a guitar-ization of the song I like to sing to my children when
reading
[You and Me and the Wishing Tree](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=you+and+me+and+the+wishing+tree).

[score](https://github.com/skelterjohn/guitar/blob/master/pdf/wishingtree.pdf)

### Study No. 1 (Regret)

This is a study I wrote to help smooth out a section in
[Media Luna](http://www.knila.nl/index.php?search=own) (long page, ctrl-f the
title).

The first string is the melody, and its first use each measure should be loud and
with vibrato. The second (and sometimes third) use of that string in each measure
should be softer, sweeter, and (most importantly) regretful. It's also full of big stretches for the left hand.

### Fantasy No. 1

This piece is intended to invoke the feel of a Final Fantasy wistful flashback seen.

[score](https://github.com/skelterjohn/guitar/blob/master/pdf/fantasy_1.pdf)

### Study No. 2 (Inversion)

I watched
[Andrew York's video on improvisation for guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyWv4uWG-MU)
and put this together to help me practice chord inversions.

[score](https://github.com/skelterjohn/guitar/blob/master/pdf/inversion.pdf)

### No Feedback

A simple piece with a repeating bass line. Has a few left-hand stretches but nothing too complicated. Perhaps best played as a meditation exersize at 2am.

## Transcriptions

### Suna no Hoshi by Tsuneo Imahori
From the Trigun soundtrack. Transcribed by ear.

This piece was played during the procession at my wedding. So, I really like it.

Plays great on either classical or acoustic steel-string.

### Rakuen by Tsuneo Imahori
From the Trigun soundtrack. Guitar/voice. Transcribed by ear.

I found numerous terrible tabs for this piece before I decided to just sit down
and transcribe it myself from the mp3. I discovered that the tuning is quite unusual,
with DAGDGD from 1 to 6, which likely accounts for all the poor arrangements I'd
discovered. I believe what I transcribed below is faithful to what was actually
played, and (as a bonus) it's not that hard once the tuning is handled.

Best played on an acoustic steel-string guitar.

I can also play things without composing or arranging them myself.

### Media Luna by Bert Alink

This piece is both beautiful and easily "under the fingers".

### Landslög by Gulli Björnsson

A friend described these pieces as "modern but not avant garde". Gulli Björnsson is a
talented young composer from Iceland currently studying in the United States. This
"Landslög" suite has eleven movements, theoretically in increasing difficulty. The
difficulty levels jump around quite a bit, but different things are difficult for 
different people.

I aim to eventually record all elevent pieces, though Landslög XI is quite challenging.
